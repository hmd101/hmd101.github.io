## Instructions:

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a Master's student in psychology at [New York University (NYU)](https://www.nyu.edu/) and in computer science at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/). I am also a guest researcher at the [Computational Center for Neuroscience of the Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/).

I am interested in human and artificial intelligence and how to bridge the gap between the two. Specifically, I am interested in developing computational models of the complex cognitive abilities of humans from visual information processing to natural language. My current research investigates to what degree large language models can understand cause and effect and reason in ways similar to humans. I am also developing [tools to understand internal representations of vision models](https://github.com/plenoptic-org/plenoptic).

In October 2023, I founded the [Cognitive Science Club at NYU](https://haannaa.notion.site/Cognitive-Science-Club-NYU-b96d8d3c5a9b473f8afd7872a2bcae14), which features regular speakers and discussions on topics related to computer science, neuroscience, and psychology. Prior to starting my Master's degree at NYU on a Fulbright scholarship, I studied cognitive and computer science at the University of Tübingen with semesters abroad at National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan and Hong Kong University (HKU). 

In my free time, I enjoy running, cycling, and exploring NYC.
